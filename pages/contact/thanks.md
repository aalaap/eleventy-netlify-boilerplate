Thank you for getting in touch!

You can find the form submissions in your the <strong>Forms</strong> section under the Netlify site you deploy this to.

<em>Note: If you're running this locally and you get a `Cannot POST /contact/thanks.html` error, it's because this only works when the site is deployed to Netlify.</em>
